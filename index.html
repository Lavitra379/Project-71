                <p>An e-I Card system is installed in DON BOSCO ENGLISH SCHOOL This system takes care of the attendance system of calling roll number of every student, which is highly time consuming every day as well as to prepare reports at the end of the year. ScaniD also helps in recording the in and out time of a particular student. It also creates a parent information system e.g. everyday system sends a SMS to all the parents of Primary and Secondary section students, whose children are absent for the day. Also special SMS’s can be sent to parents in case of emergency holiday.</p>

It is a blessing to have the opportunity to give back what we learnt from our mentors and teachers. We believe that the early formative years are critical for each child to grow up as a bright, mature and a responsible individual.

Don Bosco English School in Badlapur provides an atmosphere, which helps develop an inquisitive mind for creative intelligence. We strive to build independent, responsible, global citizens through a widely accepted curriculum and practices that are founded on learner-centric education. As we open our doors to each new generation of students, expectations run high, as we believe that each and every one of them will grow into the stars in our skies. Every day, every year we scale new heights, never standing still.

On behalf of the administration and faculty, I am delighted to introduce a world of opportunities provided for your child at Don Bosco English School. I invite you to visit the school and experience its facilities.
